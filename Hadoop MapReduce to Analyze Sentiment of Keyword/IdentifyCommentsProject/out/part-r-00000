Comment = @lambacck: &quot;Other implementations ... have a potential race condition bug.&quot; Since you can't lock the file system, *all* implementations, including this one, have a race condition when considered as part of the code that calls it: another process could delete the directory between you creating it and putting something in it. I think it's best not to worry about such things in the lower level code but have a try block around the higher-level code block to catch them. That's closer to the Python spirit of asking for forgiveness.

Comment = I actually receive an UnicodeDecodeError if the path already exists. Is this a bug? Python (2.7) is probably passing the string received from the OS without checking. It probably contains some non-ascii characters, in which case the above exception fails:&#xA;&#xA;UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe3 in position 13: ordinal not in range(128)

Comment = To protect against race conditions, you can [install IPython](https://ipython.org/install.html) and use [IPython.utils.path.ensure_dir_exists()](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.utils.path.html#IPython.utils.path.ensure_dir_exists)

Comment = the &quot;b if c else d&quot; can be in ()s because it's an expression. The assignment part (&quot;a = ...&quot;) cannot, because in Python assignment is a statement. In Python, no statement can be in parentheses.
